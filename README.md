⚠️ **API Usage Note**
This project uses the free Shazam Core API via RapidAPI. It has a **daily limit of 100 requests per API key**. To avoid hitting the limit:

- Use it sparingly while testing.
- Avoid spamming reloads and searches.
- If rate-limited (403/429), generate a new API key with another RapidAPI account for development.
